This page should help explain what I personally think is the way to run Jobs Reborn version 5.1.x.x on Spigot-, and Paper 1.19 and below.

```
> jobs version
[18:55:52 INFO]: --------------------------------------------------
[18:55:52 INFO]: Jobs: 5.1.2.2 SqLite
[18:55:52 INFO]: CMILib: 1.2.5.2
[18:55:52 INFO]: Server: Paper(448) 1.19.3-R0.1-SNAPSHOT
[18:55:52 INFO]: Economy: CMIEconomy Vault: 1.7.3-b
[18:55:52 INFO]: --------------------------------------------------
```

## <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Note ahead.

- This is about Jobs 5.1.2.x and Spigot or Paper server version 1.19.4 mainly, apply the logic to 1.18.2 and other lower versions accordingly.
- More info about differences between Jobs jar files: <https://github.com/mrfdev/Jobs/blob/main/Resources/FAQ/Jobs-jar-files.md>

- CMI version 9.4.z.x is _recommended_ as an Economy engine, but other older economy engines like EssentialsX-economy as well. 
- More info about Jobs + Economy: <https://github.com/mrfdev/Jobs/blob/main/Resources/FAQ/Jobs-economy.md>

- **CMI Lib version  1.2.5.2 or newer is required.**
- Zrips' libraries and other resources are linked below.

### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Backup

- First, I strongly recommend before making any changes to your live server to take it offline with /stop and make a complete backup of the full directory, do not forget to backup your MySQL databases if you use any. 

### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Test setup

- Before you actually update your live server it's recommended to have a test instance you can try stuff out on. This way you can detect issues and concerns early and learn to address those. Without risking your live server!
- If this testing takes hours and days and you have new live data because players keep playing, obviously take the live server offline and backup again, before making the final changes.

### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Before we start to install and/or upgrade Jobs 5

- `/stop` your server. Do the backup thing, and make a test server.

- Go to SpigotMC and download Jobs if you haven't yet. And use BuildTools.jar from SpigotMC to build the latest version of Spigot 1.18.2 or download Paper 1.18.2 from their site.

- If you are not yet running CMILib then it will automatically download it. If this isn't the case due to firewalls or whatever reason, you can also manually download it here: <https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/87610/>

- Now that we have the latest files and are installing or upgrading from an older version to a new version, and we have a backup. It's time to replace any existing jars.

### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> First time Installalation

If you already are running Jobs, you can skip this and go straight to Upgrading (see below).

- Put the downloaded Jobs `.jar` in the plugins/ directory. 

- Start the server and let it complete loading.

- Keep an eye on the console, the `latest.log` will also have all the details. If something goes wrong, take note. And try to figure out what is up and try again. 

- If you spot any bugs, confirm them, and report them to Zrip's Github as a new issue.

- When the server has started, Jobs will automatically download languages, CMI Lib and you're ready to **Finish** (see below)

### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Upgrading Jobs

If you are installing it for the first time, go to the Installing steps above and skip the upgrading steps.

- Keep the existing `~/plugins/Jobs/` folder, do not delete it.

- Keep the existing `~/plugins/CMILib/` folder, do not delete it.

- If you don't have the CMILib folder, don't worry, it will create it for you.

- If you have the old CMILib version, don't worry, Jobs will auto-upgrade it, and we will clean up after.

- Remove the old Jobs `.jar` you're using from the plugins/ directory. 

- Put the freshly downloaded Jobs `.jar` in the plugins/ directory. 

- Start the server and let it complete loading.

- Keep an eye on the console, the `latest.log` will also have all the details. If something goes wrong, take note. And try to figure out what is up and try again.

- When the server has started, Jobs will automatically download languages, CMILib and you're ready to **Finish** (see below)

- If your plugins/ directory has the old CMILib `.jar` files, it is okay to remove them now. Keep the new .jar of course.

### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> Finishing up.

Okay, you've backed everything up, you've made a test setup, and you've either fresh installed or upgraded Jobs. Just one more thing before you can play with this test setup that is now running.

- This test setup has to /stop and restart once. This way any new languages, converted data, and updated libraries can be put to use.

- And now you can start it again. Keep an eye on the console (or `latest.log`) again and make sure there's no weird errors.

And that's it! You're done.

What a list huh, okay, now you have experience, you have tested, and you can do it again: but on the live server! Have fun with Jobs.

#### <g-emoji class="g-emoji" alias="information_source" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2139.png">ℹ️</g-emoji> What about 1.16.5?

Personally I feel this is now outdated, and replaced by 1.19 or newer, please upgrade first, but yes, Jobs 5 works on 1.18.2 as well. And other lower versions.
