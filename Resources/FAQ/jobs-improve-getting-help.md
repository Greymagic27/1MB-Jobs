To get the best help possible, we need information, then Zrips on Github or the community members on Discord can help you better.

- Have some patience. Post the question, provide info, and just wait.
- We always advise people to stay current and make frequent backups!
- Provide the information if you can (console commands):

**# Server engine:** `ver`
**# Plugin details:** `jobs version`
**# CMI-Library:** `ver CMILib`
**# Vault version:** `ver Vault`
**# Economy manager:** `ver CMI`
**# Permission Manager:** `ver LuckPerms`

- Keep an eye on the console or check the logs to make sure you spot any errors during the startup of any plugins. If you see a related error, instead of pasting a wall of text into a chat, try using a text host service, like [This Hastebin instance from md-5](https://paste.md-5.net/)

other text hosting sites are also available:

[pastes.dev from Lucko](https://pastes.dev/)  
[hastebin instance from helpch.at](https://paste.helpch.at)
