## I have a bug. Fix it

Yeah, life is not that easy. Unfortunately, we deal in bug reports, not magic shows. So we will need more information.

First, please check that you're on the latest build of your service engine; type: `/ver` and see how far behind you are.

Update to the latest versions of [CMILib](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/cmilib.87610/) and [Jobs](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/jobs-reborn.4216/)

Try again. If it still fails, check the latest.log file to see the errors during startup and resolve those.

If you believe you've found a bug, gather the info about your server and go to Zrips's Github and submit a new issue for review.

Provide at least the following:
What the problem is, and how can it be reproduced
What you've done to mitigate it so far.
The output of the command /ver
Versions of other plugins related to your problem
include the entire error message.
