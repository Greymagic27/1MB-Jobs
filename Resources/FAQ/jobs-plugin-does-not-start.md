## The plugin doesn't start

That sucks, but we require more info to help.

In your server's console, there will be a Jobs related error/warning.
(or, if you missed it originally it will be in latest.log)

If the Error mentions missing CMILib, you are missing a required dependency as Jobs needs CMILib to work. You should [download] (<https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/cmilib.87610/>) it.

You can search for the error message in the logs/latest.log in your server's installation directory if you missed it in the console.
