### How can I enable certain user groups to have more jobs than others?

Check the answer to this question first: `### How can I have players join only X amount of jobs?` and then update your group permission to have a higher number:

```
jobs.max.5
```

For example, `lp group VIP permission set jobs.max.5 true`
