## Helping Translate Jobs

If some piece of text is wrong or doesn't exist for your current language file, suggest new text to replace it.

We will then accept and merge the change, and it will make its way to a possible next release version.

- You can find translations in the `~plugins/jobs/` directory in their respected directory.
- Some phrases that multiple Zrips plugins use are in the locale files under `~plugins/CMILib/translations`
