# FAQ - Can I do This Thing per job?

<topMenu>

---

Maybe, it depends on what This Thing is. The first thing you want to do is [check the example job config and read it.](https://github.com/Zrips/Jobs/blob/master/src/main/resources/jobs/_EXAMPLE.yml) If you are too lazy to read it, do word searches. There's a lot you can set per job, such as:

- Max level
- Soft payout limits
- Progression calculations
- GUI slot and item
- Permissions for joining the job, gaining levels, or when certain conditions are met
- Commands on joining, leaving, and levelling up
- World blacklist or whitelist
- Should the job ignore the maximum job limit
- Limiting certain items to be used only by members of that job that have reached a particular level

The example file is your friend. [Always check it first.](https://github.com/Zrips/Jobs/blob/master/src/main/resources/jobs/_EXAMPLE.yml)
