## How do I open `/jobs` to go to `/jobs browse`?

> Hi, is there any way to be able to open the jobs menu using `/jobs` and not `/jobs browse`

Not by default, another plugin might be required to alias the `/jobs` command, ensuring that it opens `/jobs browse` instead of `/jobs help`. It would be nice to have a toggle.

CMI allows you to make alias commands, you could utilize this probably.
