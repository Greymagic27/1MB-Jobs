# FAQ - Jobs is lagging my server, shows in timings report

That's not how the timings work. Jobs showing up as a lagging can mean many things. Another plugin can hang the main thread, forcing a queue to build up or other tasks to wait before completing.

We will need to know much more information, including your timings report.

Going to [Github](https://github.com/zrips/Jobs/issues) and starting a new issue is the best way to deal with that.

Read the minimum requirements for a bug report from the previous question before posting.
