## Jobs Points Explained

How can I use the points I earn from jobs?

You can use them in the Jobs Shop to buy custom boosted items or anything else the owner of your server cares to set up.

With the Jobs API, you can also use them in other plugins like GUI shop.

If you are running multiple servers, you can use a shared MySQL database to track points between all servers.

With the API and multiserver support, you can build anything you can imagine with the points system.

You can also disable all the individual payout types in the generalConfig.yml like so:

`PaymentMethods: Money: true Points: false Exp: true`

Set any of these to either true or false to enable or disable the payouts of that type.
